1. "index.html": This is the main HTML file that will contain the structure of the website. It will include references to the CSS files for styling. It will contain various DOM elements with unique id names that can be targeted by CSS for styling.

2. "styles.css": This is the main CSS file that will contain custom styles for the website. It will use class and id selectors that correspond to the DOM elements in the "index.html" file.

3. "tailwind.css": This is the Tailwind CSS file that will contain utility classes for styling the website. It will be referenced in the "index.html" file and can be used in conjunction with the custom styles in the "styles.css" file.

Shared Dependencies:

1. DOM Element IDs: These are unique identifiers for elements in the "index.html" file that can be targeted by the CSS files for styling. Examples could include "header", "main", "footer", etc.

2. CSS Class Names: These are identifiers that can be applied to multiple elements in the "index.html" file. They can be defined in either the "styles.css" or "tailwind.css" files and used to apply consistent styling across multiple elements.

3. CSS Selectors: These are used in the CSS files to target specific elements, classes, or ids in the "index.html" file for styling.

4. File References: The "index.html" file will need to include references to the "styles.css" and "tailwind.css" files so that the styles defined in those files can be applied to the website.

5. Tailwind Utility Classes: These are predefined classes in the "tailwind.css" file that can be used to quickly apply styles to elements in the "index.html" file. Examples could include "text-center", "bg-black", "text-white", etc.
